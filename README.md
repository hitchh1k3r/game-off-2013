## Support and Requirements

The game has been tested primarily on Chrome, but should work in Opera and Safari (with WebGL enabled). Firefox has had some issues, but is working intermittently. For maximum compatibility you should try to use the [newest version of Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome).

Additionally parts of the game can be fairly expensive on the graphics card, some laptops and older desktops will probably have issues with parts of the game. The game has been tested and works fine on a GeForce GTX 660 Ti, and acceptably well on a Radeon HD 5450 and 6670, and poorly on a Radeon HD 6630M, and ground to a halt on my 2010 Macbook. Your millage my vary.
